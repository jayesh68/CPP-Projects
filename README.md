# CPP-Projects

The repository contains 3 C++ programs representing different projects

1. The 8_puzzle.cpp is a project to solve an 8 puzzle problem using BFS. An inital start node is given by the user. The blank tile (0) is identified and moved in different directions to obtain the respective children of the previous node. This would continue until the goal node is identified. The path taken to reach the goal is node is backtracked by storing the parent information of the respective children.

2. The banking.cpp is a project representing a banking database system where the bank representative can perform different operations such as creating a bank account, viewing all the account details, searching for a particular record and deleting a record from file.
 
3. The snak_ladd.cpp is a project to predict the number of dice thows to reach the end point with different obstacles in the form of snakes and ladders to assist in reaching the end point. The game would consists of 100 points where the user can move forward with dice throws. When encountering a snake the user would get further away from the end point whereas using a ladder the user can advance closer to the end point. This program predicts the number of dice throws required to reach the final point using BFS with the presence of obstacles in the form of snakes and assitance in the form of ladders.
